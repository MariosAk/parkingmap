## How It Works üöÄ

1. **User Authentication**: 
   - Users log in or register securely using Firebase Authentication.
   
2. **Parking Spot Sharing**:
   - Users can declare when they are leaving a parking spot, making it available for others to find.
   - Spots can also be marked as unavailable by long-pressing on a marker.

3. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - The app fetches available parking spots from the backend API and updates the map view in real-time.
   - Parking spots within the visible map area are listed for easy access.

4. **Notifications**:
   - Users searching within the same area are grouped into Firebase Messaging topics.
   - Notifications are sent when a new spot becomes available in their area.

5. **Backend**:
   - The backend, hosted on Render, processes user actions, manages parking spot data, and interacts with the MariaDB database hosted on Clever Cloud.

6. **Data Flow**:
   - The mobile app communicates with the backend using secure API endpoints.
   - The backend retrieves and updates parking spot data from the database as needed.
